# Will I Burn?  ![swift-icon](https://img.shields.io/badge/Swift-FA7343?style=for-the-badge&logo=swift&logoColor=white)
Will I Burn is a weather iOS mobile application with a twist. It detects user's location and checks the current UV index to display how much time (mins) they can sit outside before they get a sunburn.

## Motivation💪
This project was created as a deeper dive into learning about Swift, Pods, Location, Permissions, APIs and more.
